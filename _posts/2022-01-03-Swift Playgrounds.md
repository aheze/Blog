The interface is split into 3 parts:

- **Left:** The sidebar, which shows all your files
- **Center:** The place where you write code
- **Right:** The app preview, which shows the result of your code

At the top, there's some more buttons:

1. Return to the app gallery
2. Hide/show the sidebar
3. Create a new file
4. Run your code in a separate window
5. Browse the presets library
6. More options
7. Expand the preview to full-screen
8. Hide the preview

That's pretty much it.
