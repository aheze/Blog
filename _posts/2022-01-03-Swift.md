# Introduction

Remember that SwiftUI code from the previous article?

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, world!")
        .foregroundColor(Color.blue)
    }
}
```

That's actually **swift code**. Pretty advanced swift code, but it's still swift. 

- `View` is a protocol
- The brackets `{}` are closures
- `"Hello, world!"` is a string
- `.blue` is a variable

But for now, let's start simpler.

### Creating a variable
This defines `string` to be a `String`, and initializes it.

```swift
let string: String = "Hello"
```
