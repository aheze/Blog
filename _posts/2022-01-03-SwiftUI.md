### Overview

You've probably never heard of [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) before, so I'll clear some things up.

- SwiftUI is a *framework*, which just means "developer tool."
- SwiftUI is built using the Swift programming language, which we'll go over in the next section.
- SwiftUI is kind of like HTML -- you write apps using it.

In SwiftUI, there are 2 main concepts: **Views** and **View Modifiers**. You compose these together to form a user interface (that's that the "UI" part stands for in SwiftUI). Here's the basic structure of a view:


```swift
/// 1.
struct ContentView: View {

    /// 2.
    var body: some View {

        /// 3.
        Text("Hello, world!")

        /// 4.
        .foregroundColor(Color.blue)
    }
}
```

1. This declares a custom view with the name "ContentView."
2. This is where you put sub-views inside.
3. This is another view, called `Text`. The "Hello World" part is a parameter, which we'll go over later.
4. This is a view modifier, which is attached to the `Text`. As you can assume, it changes the text's color to blue.

[`Text`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text) is a built-in view. There are several dozen more of these views -- here's a [list](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view#conforming-types). However, we'll only focus on a couple.

At its core, that's all SwiftUI is -- a framework to combine and modify views. In the next section, we'll go over SwiftUI in more detail.
